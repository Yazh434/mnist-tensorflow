**MNIST Digit Classification with TensorFlow**

This project aims to build and train a neural network model in TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy.

Technical Approach:

1. Data Preprocessing:

Download and access the MNIST dataset containing thousands of labeled 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Normalize pixel values between 0 and 1 for optimal model training.
Split the data into training, validation, and test sets for efficient model development and evaluation.


2. Model Architecture:

Design a sequential neural network model with the following key components:

Flatten layer: Converts each 28x28 image into a 784-dimensional vector for easier processing.

Hidden layer: Introduces non-linearity with 128 neurons and ReLU activation function to extract complex features from the data.

Output layer: Contains 10 neurons, one for each digit class, with softmax activation for probability distribution of predicted digit.



3. Model Training:

Implement the Adam optimizer (a variant of gradient descent) to iteratively adjust model parameters based on the training data and labels.

Train the model for a predefined number of epochs (iterations over the training data) to optimize its performance.

Utilize early stopping to prevent overfitting and monitor validation accuracy for optimal model selection.


4. Evaluation and Analysis:

Evaluate the model's performance on the unseen test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Analyze the model's behavior through visualizations of learned weights and activations to understand how it differentiates between different digits.

Investigate hyperparameter tuning techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to further improve accuracy and robustness.


5. Potential Extensions:

Explore deeper and more complex neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to potentially achieve higher accuracy.

Implement techniques like regularization and dropout to prevent overfitting and improve generalizability.

Deploy the trained model as a web application or mobile app for real-time digit recognition.
